# LLMs

You will find my projects on large language models (LLMs) in this page. 

1. The first project is to fine-tune Llama 2 to for travelling topics. The data collection on reddit with more than 8000 question-answer pairs is done by me and Phuoc Bui. In the notebook file, you will see a step-by-step guide to fine-tune any LLM with your own dataset.

2. The second project is to fine-tune and build a simple chatbot with Flan T5 small. The fine-tuning and response process is much faster than Llama 2, due to much less number of parameters. But it may take a lot of time to fine-tune Flan T5 small, because the answer is much less coherent than Llama 2.
